Question :

Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.
Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.
Input: head = [1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10

Constraints:

The Linked List is not empty.
Number of nodes will not exceed 30.
Each node's value is either 0 or 1.

Solution :

class Solution {
public:
    int getDecimalValue(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode *p = head;
        int dec = 0, count = 0;
        long long base;
        while(p != NULL){
            p = p->next;
            count++;
        }
        base = count - 1;
        p = head;
        while(p != NULL){
            dec = dec + (p->val * pow(2, base));
            base -= 1;
            p = p->next;
        }
        return dec;
    }
};
