Question 

Given a stack with push(), pop(), empty() operations, delete the middle of the stack without using any additional data structure.
Middle: ceil((size_of_stack+1)/2) (1-based index)
 
Example 1:
Input: 
Stack = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Output:
ModifiedStack = {1, 2, 4, 5}
Explanation:
As the number of elements is 5 , 
hence the middle element will be the 3rd
element which is deleted

Example 2:
Input: 
Stack = {1 2 3 4}
Output:
ModifiedStack = {1 3 4}
Explanation:
As the number of elements is 4 , 
hence the middle element will be the 2nd
element which is deleted
 
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function deleteMid() which takes the stack and its size as input parameters and modifies the stack in-place.
Note: The output shows the stack from top to bottom.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
2 ≤ size of stack ≤ 100


Solution : 
class Solution
{
    public:
    //Function to delete middle element of a stack.
    void solve(stack<int>&s ,int count , int size){
        //Base Case
        if(count==size/2){
            s.pop();
            return;
        }
        int num = s.top();
          s.pop();
        
        //Recursive Call
        solve(s ,count+1 , size);
        s.push(num);
        
    }
    void deleteMid(stack<int>&s, int sizeOfStack)
    {
        // code here..
        int count = 0;
        solve(s ,count , sizeOfStack);
        
    }
};

// O(n) O(1)
